Welcome to the world of Selenium WebDriver! As creator of WebDriver, Simon Stewart proclamed: "If you have WebDriver APIs in your test methods, You're Doing It Wrong". Page Object Model is an Object Repository design pattern in Selenium WebDriver. With its implementation the operations and flows in the UI are decoupled from verification/assersion points, which makes code cleaner and easy to understand.
